# Conditional-Fixed-Income-Correlations-Applying-Extreme-Value-Theory

This repository contains the code of the "Conditional Fixed Income Correlations: Skews and Straddles" article that was published in the Journal of Fixed Income. The paper is accessible through this link:

There are three R scripts that estimate conditional correlations using extreme value theory

- R_asymmetricCorrelations_negative_exceedances_Gumbel.R
- R_asymmetricCorrelations_positve_exceedances_Gumbel.R. 
- R_asymmetricCorrelations_cross_exceedances_Gumbel.R

I will next briefly outline the purpose of each of these scripts.
